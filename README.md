# About Me

I'm a versatile artist that is always looking to learn more and expand his skillset. Right now I'm focusing on becoming better at drawing digitally using a tablet and I'm exploring different software to create assets that can be used in games. When I have free time I like to draw(preferably with pencils) and I also enjoy creating mods for games using different editors. I like to draw character concepts, real life people and some other characters I've met throughout gaming and watching movies. I also like designing levels and enemy creatures.

For the moment my goal is to improve and expand on my artist skills as I'm learning how to use some of the more popular programs used in AAA companies.

## Procedural city

- Procedurally created city
- 18 shapes used for all buildings
- several patterns created in Substance Designer are used for additional detail on the buildings
- meshes fit one another, allowing for the creation of countless combinations
- additional properties embedded in the exported Substance Designer material, allowing for customization inside Unity

A poor medieval city, themed after Novigrad from Witcher 3. Almost every asset out of it is controlled by procedurally. The main tools used are Maya(for the creation of meshes) and Substance Designer plus a bit of help from Substance Painter. 

## 3d Character creation

- 3d character created using Maya and ZBrush
- Modernately complex rig
- Simple animations such as walking, jumping, sprinting, attacking
- Concept and everything else made by me

My first 3d character! Most meshes created in Maya and meshes that require sculpting are made with the help of ZBrush and retopologised back in Maya. Using character controllers, IK handles, constraints and cloak animated using Maya's physics simulation tools(NCloth).

## Substance Painter and Rendering

- Textures created by hand with added procedural patterns.

Substance Painter is the main software I use for texturing and the tool I used to texture my character...

- Scene set up in Maya
- Custom 3d assets for decoration

Maya's shader materials and lights are used to enhance the scene.

## 3d Animations

- 3d animations created inside Maya
- High quanity and low complexity created in a short period of time

This compilation shows animations I created for a school project where I took the role of a more "technical" artist. Every character rig and animation is created by me and some characters are also made to share the same skeleton so they can use the same animations.

## Post-processing

ENB is a free community post-processor tool developed by Boris Vorontsov and can be applied on many different games to enhance the experience. I have done just that for one of my favourite games called Skyrim... ENB is extremely complex, supporting hundreds of effects such as SSAO, SSIL, Depth Of Field, Lens FX, Bloom, HDR, Tone Mapping, Sharpening, Sun Rays, Shadows, Detailed Shadows, Reflection and others. Additionally it allows me to create entire weather systems so the game looks different depending on which weather is playing.
