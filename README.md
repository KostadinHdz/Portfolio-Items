## Procedural city

- Procedurally created city
- 18 shapes used for all buildings
- several patterns created in Substance Designer are used for additional detail on the buildings
- meshes fit one another, allowing for the creation of countless combinations
- additional properties embedded in the exported Substance Designer material, allowing for customization inside Unity

A poor medieval city, themed after Novigrad from Witcher 3. Almost every asset out of it is controlled by procedurally. The main tools used are Maya(for the creation of meshes) and Substance Designer plus a bit of help from Substance Painter. 

## 3d Character creation

- 3d character created using Maya and ZBrush
- Modernately complex rig
- Simple animations such as walking, jumping, sprinting, attacking
- Concept and everything else made by me

My first 3d character! Most meshes created in Maya and meshes that require sculpting are made with the help of ZBrush and retopologised back in Maya. Using character controllers, IK handles, constraints and cloak animated using Maya's physics simulation tools(NCloth).

## Substance Painter and Rendering

- Textures created by hand with added procedural patterns.

Substance Painter is the main software I use for texturing and the tool I used to texture my character...

- Scene set up in Maya
- Custom 3d assets for decoration

Maya's shader materials and lights are used to enhance the scene.

## 3d Animations

- 3d animations created inside Maya
- High quanity and low complexity created in a short period of time

This compilation shows animations I created for a school project where I took the role of a more "technical" artist. Every character rig and animation is created by me and some characters are also made to share the same skeleton so they can use the same animations.

## Playable game scenes

- Every asset except the controller is created by me
- A short quest with a bonus side quest
- Used Unity's Post-Processing tools to enhance the scene
- Used other effects such as reverb zones to enhance the audio
- Simple features such as player HUD and a journal people can open and read

A simple scene where the player goes on a short quest to obtain the souls of the fallen townsmen. To create all of my assets I have used Maya, Zbrush, Photoshop, Substance Painter, Substance Designer and Premiere(for some quick effects and audio edits).

- A detailed scene utilizing Unity's tools and my computer's capabilities to their maximum
- Assets are NOT mine. They are from the store + free assets provided by teachers
- The scene provides the player with a simple quest to obtain 4 items
- Simple features such as Player HUD

A scene with artistic goal - to make it as good looking as possible. Here I have learned everything I know about how Unity's post-processing tools work.

## Post-processing

https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67159637/123556820-bc090380-d78d-11eb-8b0e-4134099b83f1.mp4

ENB is a free community post-processor tool developed by Boris Vorontsov and can be applied on many different games to enhance the experience. I have done just that for one of my favourite games called Skyrim... ENB is extremely complex, supporting hundreds of effects such as SSAO, SSIL, Depth Of Field, Lens FX, Bloom, HDR, Tone Mapping, Sharpening, Sun Rays, Shadows, Detailed Shadows, Reflection and others. Additionally it allows me to create entire weather systems so the game looks different depending on which weather is playing.

## Pencil art

Drawing with pencils is how most people have started and I am no exception. This compilation contains some of my best work, although some of them are a bit old by now. I found myself enjoying drawing portraits and detailed characters the most which is why this is the only thing Portfolio worthy I brought.
